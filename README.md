Hey there! I'm Pooja Raja, an aspiring computer science student from VIT, Vellore. I am Interested in Designing, Research, Space, Software Development and Agile Methodologies. Hence, I'm always on the lookout for more problems I can help solving or a new idea I can code into a website.

Currently, I am trying to learn new skills like UI/UX design, Frontend Development and DSA. 
I see everyday as an opportunity to learn something new.

When I'm not in front of my computer, I like to sing, play the ukulele and nerd out about space.

So with that, welcome to a little insight into my brain!
