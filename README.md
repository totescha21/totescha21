Hey there! I'm Pooja Raja, an aspiring Business Analyst with a love for data analysis. I am Interested in Designing, Research, Space, Software Development and visualization. 

Currently, I am trying to learn new skills like UI/UX design, AI and DSA
I see everyday as an opportunity to learn something new.

When I'm not in front of my computer, I like to sing, play the ukulele and nerd out about space.

So with that, welcome to a little insight into my brain!
